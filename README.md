### CREAM is
* an easily applicable CRM
* an E_vernote A_pplication.
* therefore CR_EA_M. CREAM.

### Purpose
Its for a small group of people that hate filling forms.
It all starts with an email, a phone and the next todos.

### What it does
It runs on a pc, connects to evernote and creates some very
helpful notes: Just overviews of TODOs, sorted by date.
If an todo is to be done, it sends an email.
Once a day, it sends a "diff-mail" so that the user
can see, which todos have changed, which will be soon to
be done or which ones disapeared.
And finally, it links mails to the notes. So if you want
to put emails to your crm-contacts, just forward them to
an condigurable email. CREAM will get them, search for the
correspondig not and connect then.
